# SPTracer
Spectral Path Tracer (physically based rendering). This is a hobby project to study the basics of physically based rendering.
Currently it supports some parts of MDLA (from Cornell University) and OBJ formats. It was tested on Cornell Box model from here: http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/online/box/box.mdla and OBJ models from here: http://graphics.cs.williams.edu/data/meshes.xml.
